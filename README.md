# YourPet

Welcome to `YourPet`, a side project I started with three main goals:

- Don't get too rusty in my coding skills since my current role doesn't have much room to do coding.
- Play around with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile so I get to explore its potential first hand.
- Play with any other technology I might come across and attracts me. Below you can find some that I have currently in mind (can't promise I will get to try them all, but PR are always welcomed)

## Things to try out

- [ ] Jetpack compose
- [ ] Swift UI
- [ ] Hilt
- [ ] Flow
- [ ] Room
